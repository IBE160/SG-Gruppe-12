# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 1-3-user-login-session-management - User Login & Session Management
Outcome: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 0, Minor: 3)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)
(None)

## Major Issues (Should Fix)
(None)

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

1. **Previous Story Continuity Check**: The "Learnings from Previous Story" subsection exists but does not include a direct source citation `[Source: stories/{{previous_story_key}}.md]`.
2. **Source Document Coverage Check**: While testing is included in tasks, a specific mention of "Testing standards" in Dev Notes as defined in `testing-strategy.md` (if it existed as a separate doc) is not explicitly present.
3. **Story Structure Check**: The Change Log section is initialized, but a placeholder for "Change Log" is missing.

## Successes

- All story fields (asA/iWant/soThat), Acceptance Criteria, and Tasks/Subtasks are accurately captured from the source documents.
- Relevant documentation, code references, interfaces, constraints, dependencies, and testing information are included and appropriately cited.
- Acceptance Criteria quality is high, and tasks are well-mapped to ACs.
- Dev Notes provide specific architectural guidance and references.
- Story structure is well-formed, with the correct status and necessary Dev Agent Record sections.
